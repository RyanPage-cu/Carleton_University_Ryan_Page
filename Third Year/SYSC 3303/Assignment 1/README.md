# SYSC 3303 Assignment #1 - Ryan Page (101268082)

**101268082_Assignment1.cpp** - Is the Sandwich Making Chefs Problem C++ Code

(Note -- Code seems to have some deadlock doesn't make all 20 sandwiches everytime 
        please try and restart the code a couple of times, it will sometimes make 
        all 20 but sometimes gets stuck. I did try to go through the debugger to
        figure out where it stops and couldn't find anything other than all threads
        running and not doing anything)
